# Sprint Retrospectives

Learn how to conduct effective retrospectives to improve team performance over time.

## Purpose of Retrospectives

Retrospectives help teams:

- Reflect on their work process
- Identify what went well and what didn't
- Generate actionable improvements
- Build team cohesion

## Conducting a Retrospective

1. Schedule the meeting for the end of the sprint
2. Create a retrospective in the system
3. Ask team members to add their thoughts on:
   - What went well
   - What could be improved
   - Actions to take in the next sprint
4. Discuss each point as a team
5. Document agreed-upon action items

## Retrospective Templates

The system provides several retrospective templates:

- **Start, Stop, Continue**: What to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing
- **Glad, Sad, Mad**: Positive experiences, negative experiences, and external frustrations
- **4Ls**: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
- **Custom**: Create your own format
