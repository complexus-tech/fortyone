# Managing Sprints

Learn how to track and adjust sprints as they progress.

## Sprint Overview

The sprint dashboard provides:

- Progress toward sprint completion
- Status of all stories in the sprint
- Team velocity and capacity
- Burndown chart showing work remaining
- Sprint health indicators

## Daily Stand-ups

Use the sprint board during daily stand-ups to:

1. Update story statuses
2. Identify blockers
3. Track progress toward sprint goals
4. Make necessary adjustments to the plan

## Mid-Sprint Adjustments

Sometimes sprints need to be adjusted:

- Adding high-priority stories: Use caution and consider team capacity
- Removing stories: Document why stories are being removed
- Scope changes: Avoid if possible, but document when necessary
- Extending sprints: Generally not recommended, but sometimes unavoidable
