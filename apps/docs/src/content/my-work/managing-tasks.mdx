# Managing Your Tasks

Learn how to view, organize, and prioritize your assigned work.

## My Work Dashboard

The My Work dashboard shows:

- Stories assigned to you
- Stories you've created
- Stories you're following
- Recent activity on your stories

## Viewing Your Tasks

Tasks can be viewed in different formats:

- **List view**: Detailed information about each task
- **Board view**: Kanban-style view of task statuses
- **Calendar view**: Timeline of tasks by due date
- **Focus view**: Distraction-free view of individual tasks

## Task Prioritization

Prioritize your work efficiently:

1. Use the drag-and-drop interface to order tasks
2. Set priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
3. Use filters to focus on specific projects or story types
4. Create custom views for different work contexts
