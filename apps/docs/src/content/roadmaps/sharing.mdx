## Sharing Options

Roadmaps can be shared with different audiences:

1. Open the roadmap settings
2. Navigate to the "Sharing" tab
3. Set the visibility level:
   - Private: Only specific users
   - Team: All team members
   - Organization: Everyone in your organization
   - Public: Anyone with the link
4. Set edit permissions separately from view permissions
