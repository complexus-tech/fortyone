# Managing Stories

Learn how to update, organize, and track stories through their lifecycle.

## Story States

Stories move through different states as they progress:

- **Backlog**: Stories that are not yet scheduled
- **Ready**: Stories that are ready to be worked on
- **In Progress**: Stories currently being worked on
- **Review**: Stories awaiting review or testing
- **Done**: Completed stories

## Updating Stories

1. Open the story you want to update
2. Click "Edit" to modify story details
3. Update the status using the dropdown or kanban board
4. Add comments to document progress or ask questions
5. Link related stories or resources

## Prioritizing Stories

Stories can be prioritized by:

- Dragging and dropping in the backlog view
- Setting priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Using custom fields for specific prioritization frameworks
