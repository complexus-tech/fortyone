# Story Relationships and Dependencies

Learn how to establish and manage relationships between stories.

## Types of Relationships

- **Blocks/Blocked by**: A story that prevents another from progressing
- **Related to**: Stories that are connected but not dependent
- **Duplicates/Duplicated by**: Stories that represent the same work
- **Parent/Child**: Hierarchical relationship (epics and sub-tasks)

## Creating Relationships

1. Open the story you want to establish a relationship for
2. Navigate to the "Links" or "Relationships" section
3. Click "Add Link"
4. Search for the related story
5. Select the relationship type
6. Confirm the relationship

## Managing Dependencies

Dependencies affect how stories can be scheduled:

- Stories blocked by others cannot move to "In Progress" until blockers are resolved
- The system highlights dependency conflicts in sprint planning
- Dependency graphs visualize complex relationship networks
