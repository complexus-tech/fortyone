# Creating Stories

Learn how to create well-structured stories that clearly communicate requirements.

## Basic Story Creation

1. Navigate to your project or team workspace
2. Click the "New Story" button
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Title: A concise summary of the work
   - Description: Detailed explanation of requirements
   - Type: Feature, bug, task, etc.
   - Priority: Importance of the story
4. Click "Create" to save the story

## Writing Effective Stories

Effective stories typically follow this format:

```
As a [user type]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Good stories include clear acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete:

- Specific, testable conditions
- Clear "done" state
- No ambiguity
