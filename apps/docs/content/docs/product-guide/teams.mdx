## Understanding Teams in FortyOne

Teams in FortyOne are groups of workspace members. They help organize work, structure projects, and provide focused views for different groups within your organization.

### What are Teams?

Teams serve several key purposes:

- **Organization**: Group users who work together on specific projects or functional areas (e.g., "Frontend Developers," "Marketing Q3 Campaign").
- **Work Structuring**: Tasks, Objectives, and other work items are assigned to specific teams, making it clear who is responsible.
- **Focused Views**: Team members access views that show only the work relevant to their team, reducing noise and improving focus.
- **Access Control**: Admins can make teams "Private," limiting access to members and administrators. Public teams and their work are visible to everyone in the workspace. For details on privacy settings, see [Team Administration](/administration/features/teams).

Each team has a name, a unique code (used as a prefix for team-specific items), and an identifying color. You can also see how many members are part of a team.

### Benefits of Using Teams

Leveraging teams in FortyOne offers several advantages:

- **Improved Clarity**: Clearly defined team responsibilities mean everyone knows who owns what.
- **Enhanced Focus**: Team-specific views allow members to concentrate on their tasks without distractions from other projects.
- **Streamlined Collaboration**: Centralized team views and the ability to assign work to teams make collaboration smoother.
- **Better Project Tracking**: See progress at a team level, helping to manage resources and timelines more effectively.

## Accessing Team Information and Views

Team-related information and work items are accessible through various parts of the application.

### Team-Specific Work Item Views

The primary way to interact with teams is by viewing work items (Tasks, Objectives, Sprints) in the context of a specific team.

You navigate to a team's dedicated page for these items through the application's navigation, by selecting a team and then choosing to view its tasks or objectives.

These views display:

- A list or board of work items assigned to that team.
- Options to filter, sort, and change layouts (e.g., list view, Kanban board) specific to the team's items.

## Assigning Tasks to a Team

You assign a task to a team:

- **During Creation**: When creating a new task, there is a field or dropdown to select the team.

## Assigning Objectives to a Team

Similarly, objectives are associated with a team:

- **During Creation**: The new objective form allows you to specify the responsible team.

  Assigning an item to a team makes it visible in that team's specific views and
  can influence who receives notifications about updates to that item.
</Callout>

## Team Communication

- **Mentions**: You mention individual team members (`@username`) in comments on tasks or objectives to draw their attention.
- **Notifications**: Notifications are primarily based on individual assignment to, or participation in, specific work items, rather than broad team-based alerts.

### Shared Context

By organizing work under teams, FortyOne ensures that all team members have a shared understanding of:

- Current tasks and their statuses.
- Team objectives and their progress.
- Relevant discussions and decisions captured in comments.

## Managing Team Membership and Settings (User Perspective)

As a general user, your interaction with team settings is limited, with most administrative tasks handled by workspace admins.

- **Joining or Leaving a Team**:
  - **Public Teams**: Users can join public teams directly.
  - **Private Teams**: To join a private team, an administrator must invite the user.
    Leaving any team is done through context menu under "Your Teams".

<Callout title="Administrative Team Management">
For creating new teams, configuring team properties (name, code, color, privacy), managing team workflows, and adding/removing members definitively, workspace administrators should navigate to **Settings > Teams** (under Features).

## Best Practices for Team Collaboration in FortyOne

- **Clearly Define Teams**: Ensure each team has a clear purpose and a well-understood scope of work.
- **Consistent Assignment**: Make sure all relevant work items are assigned to the correct team.
- **Utilize Team Views**: Encourage team members to use their team-specific views to stay focused.
- **Regularly Review Team Workloads**: Use team views to monitor progress and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Leverage Comments for Discussion**: Keep conversations about specific work items within those items for easy reference by the team.
