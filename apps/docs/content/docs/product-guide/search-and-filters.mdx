## Global Search in Complexus

Complexus provides a powerful global search to help you quickly find any work item, such as stories, objectives, and more, across your entire workspace.

### Accessing Search

You access the global search functionality in several ways:

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `/` (forward slash) from anywhere in the application to open the search interface.
- **Sidebar Button**: Click the search icon (magnifying glass) located in the main sidebar.

- **Command Bar**: Open the command bar (e.g., using `Cmd + K`) and type "Search" or a search term to initiate a search or navigate to the search page.

### Using the Search Page

Once you activate search or navigate to the search page, you see a dedicated interface designed for finding your work items efficiently.

**1. Search Input Bar:**

- Enter your keywords, item titles, IDs, or any relevant text into the search bar at the top.
- Complexus searches across various fields of your work items to find matches.

**2. Scoping Your Search (Tabs):**

- Below the search bar, you find tabs such as "All results," "Stories," and "Objectives."
- Click on these tabs to narrow down your search results to specific types of work items:
  - **All results**: Shows matches from all item types.
  - **Stories**: Displays only stories matching your query.
  - **Objectives**: Shows only objectives matching your query.

**3. Understanding Search Results:**

- Search results are displayed in a list.
- Each item in the list provides a summary of key information, including:
  - Item Title
  - Type (indicated by an icon)
  - Key Properties: Such as Status, Priority, Assignee, Team, Due Date, and Health/Progress.
    This allows you to quickly identify relevant items without needing to open each one.

## Filtering Work Items

Complexus allows you to refine your views of work items using filters. While the global search page provides high-level type filtering (Stories, Objectives), more granular filtering options are available in various list and board views throughout the application.

### Common Filter Criteria

- Status (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Done)
- Priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
- Assignee(s)
- Team(s)
- Labels/Tags
- Due Dates or Date Ranges
