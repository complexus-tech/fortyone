## Overview of Roles in Complexus

Complexus uses a role-based access control system to ensure that users have appropriate access to workspace features and data. Assigning roles helps maintain security, streamline workflows, and manage collaboration effectively.

There are three primary roles available:

- **Admin**
- **Member**
- **Guest**

## Role Definitions and Permissions

Below is a detailed breakdown of each role and its associated permissions within Complexus.

### Admin

Admins have the highest level of access and control over the workspace. They are typically responsible for overall workspace management, billing, and user administration.

**Key Permissions for Admins:**

- Full access to all workspace data, settings, and features.
- Manage billing, subscriptions, and payment information.
- Configure global workspace settings (e.g., custom terminology, integrations, security policies).
- Invite new users to the workspace.
- Assign and change roles for any user (including promoting Members to Admins or demoting users).
- Remove users from the workspace.
- Manage team creation.
- Access and manage API tokens.
- Delete the entire workspace.

### Member

Members are standard users within the workspace who can actively create, edit, and collaborate on work items. This is the most common role for team members contributing to objectives.

**Key Permissions for Members:**

- Create, edit, delete, and manage stories, objectives, key results, and other work items.
- Comment on items and collaborate with other users.
- Join public teams and view information relevant to their assigned work and teams.
- Cannot access workspace-level administrative settings such as billing, global workspace configuration, or manage other users' roles.

### Guest

Guests have limited, read-only access to the workspace. This role is designed for external collaborators, clients, or stakeholders who need to view progress or specific information without having editing capabilities.

**Key Characteristics of Guests:**

- **Read-Only Access**: Guests can view specific items or sections of the workspace they have been explicitly invited to or granted access to. They cannot create, edit, or delete work items.
- **Collaboration**: They are able to leave comments on specific items.
- **Cost**: Inviting Guests to your workspace is free of charge.
- **Plan Availability**: The Guest role is exclusively available on **paid subscription plans** (e.g., Pro, Business, Enterprise). Workspaces on a free plan cannot invite or utilize Guest users.

    existing Guest users will likely lose access, or their access will become
    highly restricted, as the Guest role is a feature of paid plans. New Guests
    cannot be invited on a free plan.
