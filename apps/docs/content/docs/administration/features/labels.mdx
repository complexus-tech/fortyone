## Workspace Labels

Labels help you categorize, filter, and manage stories within your workspace. You can create and manage a central set of labels that can be applied to any story across different projects or teams.

### Managing Labels

From this settings page, you can:

- **View Existing Labels**: A list of all currently defined workspace labels will be displayed, typically showing the label's name, color, and potentially a description.
- **Create New Labels**:
  - Click the "Create Label" button (or similar, e.g., "+ New Label").
  - You will typically need to provide:
    - **Name**: The text that appears on the label (e.g., "Bug", "Feature Request", "High Priority").
    - **Color**: Choose a distinct color for the label for easy visual identification.
    - **Description (Optional)**: A brief explanation of when to use the label.
- **Edit Existing Labels**: Select a label from the list to modify its name, color, or description.
- **Delete Labels**: Remove labels that are no longer needed. Be mindful that deleting a label will remove it from all stories it was previously applied to.

_(Specific UI elements from the screenshot, like the "No labels created yet" message and the "Create Label" button, confirm this functionality. The exact layout for listing, editing, and deleting labels will be described based on a view with existing labels if available, or assumed based on standard UI patterns.)_

### Using Labels

Once created, these workspace labels will be available in the story creation/editing view, allowing users to assign one or more relevant labels to each story.
