## Default Objectives Workflow

Complexus allows you to define a custom, workspace-wide default workflow for Objectives. This workflow dictates the stages an Objective can move through, from its inception to completion or cancellation.

Each category in the workflow represents a different phase in your Objective management process.

### Workflow Categories and States

The Objectives workflow is typically organized into several categories, each containing one or more states. You can often add new states within these categories or customize existing ones.

### Customizing the Workflow

- **Adding States**: Each category (Unstarted, Started, Paused, Completed, Cancelled) has a `+` icon, that allows you to define new custom states within that category. For example, under "Started," you might add a "Review" state.
- **Editing States**: Existing states have options (via a menu) to:
  - Rename the state.
  - Change its associated icon/color.
  - Set a state as the default for its category.
  - Delete the state.

### Impact of Workflow Changes

Changes made to the Objectives workflow will affect how all Objectives are tracked and managed across the workspace. When creating or updating an Objective, users will be able to select from the states you have defined here.
