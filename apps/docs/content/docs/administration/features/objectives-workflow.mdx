## Default Objectives Workflow

Complexus allows you to define a custom, workspace-wide default workflow for Objectives. This workflow dictates the stages an Objective can move through, from its inception to completion or cancellation.

Each category in the workflow represents a different phase in your Objective management process.

### Workflow Categories and States

The Objectives workflow is typically organized into several categories, each containing one or more states. You can often add new states within these categories or customize existing ones.

Based on the screenshot, the categories and default states are:

- **Unstarted**
  - `To Do` (Default state)
- **Started**
  - `In Progress`
- **Paused**
  - `Blocked`
- **Completed**
  - `Done`
- **Cancelled**
  - _(No default state shown in this category, but one can likely be added)_

### Customizing the Workflow

- **Adding States**: Each category (Unstarted, Started, Paused, Completed, Cancelled) typically has a `+` icon or "Add state" button, allowing you to define new custom states within that phase. For example, under "Started," you might add a "Review" state.
- **Editing States**: Existing states (like `To Do`, `In Progress`) may have options (often via a `...` menu) to:
  - Rename the state.
  - Change its associated icon/color (if applicable).
  - Set a state as the default for its category (e.g., making `To Do` the default for "Unstarted").
  - Delete the state (if it's not a mandatory system state).
- **Reordering States (Possibly)**: Some systems allow reordering states within a category via drag-and-drop.

_The screenshot clearly shows the categories, the states within them, and `+` icons for adding new states, as well as `...` (ellipsis) icons next to states, suggesting options for editing or deleting them. The "Default" tag next to "To Do" indicates it's the default unstarted state._

### Impact of Workflow Changes

Changes made to the Objectives workflow will affect how all Objectives are tracked and managed across the workspace. When creating or updating an Objective, users will be able to select from the states you have defined here.

### How to Configure Objectives Workflow

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Features** from the settings navigation (or **Workspace** > **Objectives workflow** if structured that way, the screenshots show "Objectives workflow" under a "Features" submenu).
3.  Click on **Objectives workflow**.
4.  Review the existing categories and states.
5.  Use the `+` icons to add new states to relevant categories.
6.  Use the `...` (ellipsis) menu next to existing states to edit, set as default, or delete them.
7.  Ensure changes are saved if required.
