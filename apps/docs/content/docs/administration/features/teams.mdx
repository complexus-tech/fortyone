## Workspace Teams Management

This section allows workspace administrators to create and oversee the list of teams within the Complexus workspace. Teams help organize members and their work (like Stories and Objectives) into logical groups.

### Viewing Teams

A list of existing teams is displayed, typically showing key information for each team:

- **Name**: The display name of the team (e.g., "Engineering", "Product").
- **Identifier/Code**: A short code for the team (e.g., "ENG").
- **Color**: The team's assigned color for visual distinction.
- **Members**: The number of members in that team.
- **Created Date**: When the team was created.

_The "Teams" screenshot shows a table with "Name", "Members", and "Created" columns, along with a team color and code under the name._

From this list, you can usually click on a team to navigate to its detailed settings page (which might include tabs for General info, Members, and Workflow, as seen in the "Engineering" team screenshots).

### Creating a New Team

To add a new team to the workspace from the settings area:

1.  Click the **"+ Create Team"** button.
    _The "Teams" screenshot shows a "+ Create Team" button._
2.  You will be taken to a form or modal to define the new team's properties:
    _As seen in the "Create a new team" screenshot:_
    - **Team Name**: Choose a descriptive name for your team (e.g., Growth, Product, Operations).
    - **Team Code**: A short prefix for the team's stories or other items (e.g., ENG-123). This helps in quick identification.
    - **Team Color**: Select a color to visually identify the team within the workspace.
    - **Private Team (Toggle)**:
      - **Enabled**: The team is private and only visible to its members. Admins and team leads can add members to private teams.
      - **Disabled**: The team is public and visible to everyone in the workspace.
3.  Click **"Create Team"** to finalize.

### Team-Specific Settings (Brief Overview)

While the detailed management of individual teams (their members, specific workflows) might be covered in a dedicated "Teams" guide in the Product Guide or Team & Collaboration section, the settings for an individual team typically include:

- **General Information**: (As per "Engineering - General" screenshot)
  - Team Name, Team Code, Team Color, Private Team toggle.
- **Members**: (As per "Engineering - Members" screenshot)
  - View current team members and their roles within the team context.
  - Add new members to this specific team.
  - Manage roles or remove members from this specific team.
- **Workflow**: (As per "Engineering - Workflow" screenshot)
  - Configure custom workflow states for the stories/tasks managed by this specific team (e.g., Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done, Paused, Cancelled).
- **Danger Zone**: (As per "Engineering - Danger Zone" screenshot)
  - Options like deleting the team.

### How to Manage Teams (from Workspace Settings)

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Features** from the settings navigation (or **Workspace** > **Teams** if structured that way, the screenshots show "Teams" under a "Features" submenu on the left settings navigation).
3.  Click on **Teams**.
4.  View the list of existing teams or click "+ Create Team" to add a new one.
5.  Click on an individual team in the list to access its specific settings (General, Members, Workflow, Danger Zone).
