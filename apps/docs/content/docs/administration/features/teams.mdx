## Teams Management

This page allows workspace administrators to create and oversee the list of teams within the workspace. Teams help organize members and their work (like Stories and Objectives) into logical groups.

### Viewing Teams

A list of existing teams is displayed, showing key information for each team:

- **Name**: The display name of the team (e.g., "Engineering", "Product").
- **Identifier/Code**: A short code for the team (e.g., "ENG").
- **Color**: The team's assigned color for visual distinction.
- **Members**: The number of members in that team.
- **Created Date**: When the team was created.

### Creating a New Team

To add a new team to the workspace from the settings area:

1.  Click the **`Create a team`** link.
2.  You will be taken to a page to define the new team's properties:
    - **Team Name**: Choose a descriptive name for your team (e.g., Growth, Product, Operations).
    - **Team Code**: A short prefix for the team's stories or other items (e.g., ENG-123). This helps in quick identification.
    - **Team Color**: Select a color to visually identify the team within the workspace.
    - **Private Team (Toggle)**:
      - **Enabled**: The team is private and only visible to its members. Admins can add members to private teams.
      - **Disabled**: The team is public and visible to everyone in the workspace.
3.  Click **`Create Team`** to finalize.

### Team-Specific Settings (Brief Overview)

While the detailed management of individual teams (their members, specific workflows) might be covered in a dedicated "Teams" guide in the Product Guide or Team & Collaboration section, the settings for an individual team typically include:

- **General Information**: (As per "Engineering - General" screenshot)
  - Team Name, Team Code, Team Color, Private Team toggle.
- **Members**: (As per "Engineering - Members" screenshot)
  - View current team members and their roles within the team context.
  - Add new members to this specific team.
  - Manage roles or remove members from this specific team.
- **Workflow**: (As per "Engineering - Workflow" screenshot)
  - Configure custom workflow states for the stories/tasks managed by this specific team (e.g., Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done, Paused, Cancelled).
- **Danger Zone**: (As per "Engineering - Danger Zone" screenshot)
  - Options like deleting the team.
