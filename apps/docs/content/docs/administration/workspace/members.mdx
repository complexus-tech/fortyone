## Workspace Members

This section allows workspace administrators to manage who has access to the Complexus workspace and their respective permission levels.

### Inviting Members

To add new users to your workspace:

1.  Click the **"Invite Members"** button (or a similar option like "+ Add Member").
2.  You will typically be prompted to enter the email address(es) of the individuals you wish to invite.
3.  You may also be able to assign a role to the new member(s) during the invitation process (e.g., Member, Admin, Guest).
4.  Invited members will receive an email notification with a link to join the workspace.

_The screenshot shows an "Invite Members" button, confirming this functionality._

### Member List

The main view of this page will display a list of all current workspace members. For each member, you can typically see:

- **Name / Avatar**: The user's display name and profile picture.
- **Email Address**: The email associated with their account.
- **Role**: Their assigned role within the workspace (e.g., Admin, Member, Guest).
  - **Admin**: Typically has full access to workspace settings, billing, and can manage other members.
  - **Member**: Standard user with access to create and manage work items, but limited administrative privileges.
  - **Guest**: May have restricted access, perhaps to specific projects or for viewing purposes only (if this role is supported).
- **Status (Possibly)**: Indication if the invitation is pending or if the user is active.

_The screenshot shows a list of members with their name, email, and current role (Admin, Member, Guest)._

### Managing Existing Members

For each member in the list, administrators usually have a set of actions available, often accessed via a context menu (e.g., a "..." icon):

- **Change Role**: Modify the member's role (e.g., promote a Member to Admin, or downgrade an Admin).
  _As seen in the screenshot, there is a dropdown or selection mechanism for the role (Admin, Member, Guest) which also implies the ability to change it._
- **Remove from Workspace**: Revoke the member's access to the workspace. This will remove them from all teams and projects within the workspace.
- **Resend Invitation (If Pending)**: If an invited member hasn't joined yet, you might be able to resend the invitation email.

### How to Manage Members

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Workspace** from the settings navigation.
3.  Click on **Members**.
4.  Use the "Invite Members" button to add new users.
5.  Click on a member or use the context menu associated with a member to change their role or remove them.
