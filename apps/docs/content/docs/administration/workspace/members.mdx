## Workspace Members

This section allows workspace administrators to manage who has access to the Complexus workspace and their respective permission levels.

### Inviting Members

To add new users to your workspace:

1.  Click the **`Invite Members`** button.
2.  You will be prompted to enter the email address(es) of the individuals you wish to invite.
3.  You may also be able to assign a role to the new member(s) during the invitation process (e.g., Member, Admin, Guest).
4.  Invited members will receive an email notification with a link to join the workspace.

### Managing Existing Members

For each member in the workspace, administrators have a set of actions available, accessed via a context menu:

- **Change Role**: Modify the member's role (e.g., promote a Member to Admin, or downgrade an Admin).
- **Remove from Workspace**: Revoke the member's access to the workspace. This will remove them from all teams and projects within the workspace.
