## Workspace Identity

These settings define the basic information and operational parameters for your entire FortyOne workspace.

### Name and URL

- **Name**: This is the primary display name for your workspace. It appears in the UI, notifications, and browser tabs, helping users identify the workspace they are currently in.
- **URL (read-only)**: This is the unique web address for your workspace (e.g., `your-company.fortyone.app`). It is set during the initial workspace creation and cannot be changed afterwards from this panel.

## Workspace Features

You can enable or disable core FortyOne modules for your workspace to tailor the platform to your team's needs. Disabling a feature will typically hide it from the workspace UI for all users. Existing data for disabled features is preserved but becomes inaccessible until the feature is re-enabled.
