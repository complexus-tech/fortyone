## API Access Management

API tokens allow external applications and scripts to interact with your Complexus workspace programmatically. This is essential for building custom integrations, automating tasks, and extracting data.

### Generating API Tokens

- **Create New Token**: Typically, there will be an option to generate a new API token.
- **Name/Description**: You'll usually be asked to give the token a descriptive name to help you remember its purpose or which integration uses it (e.g., "Zapier Integration", "Data Export Script").
- **Scopes/Permissions**: For security, API tokens are often associated with specific permissions or scopes. This defines what actions the token can perform and what data it can access (e.g., read-only access to stories, ability to create objectives).
- **Token Display**: Once generated, the API token (a long string of characters) will be displayed. **This is often the only time the full token is shown.** You must copy and store it securely immediately. It will not be retrievable again for security reasons.

### Managing Existing Tokens

Once tokens are created, you can usually manage them from a list displaying:

- **Name/Description**: The name you assigned to the token.
- **Creation Date**: When the token was generated.
- **Last Used Date (Possibly)**: When the token was last used to make an API call.
- **Scopes**: The permissions granted to the token.
- **Actions**:
  - **Revoke/Delete Token**: Permanently disable an API token if it's no longer needed or has been compromised. This action cannot be undone, and any application using it will lose access.
  - **Edit Scopes (Less Common)**: Some systems allow modifying the scopes of an existing token, but often you need to generate a new token with the desired scopes.

### Security Best Practices for API Tokens

- **Treat tokens like passwords**: Keep them confidential and secure.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions (scopes) to each token.
- **One Token per Integration**: Use separate tokens for different applications or scripts so you can revoke access granularly.
- **Store Securely**: Do not embed tokens directly in client-side code or commit them to version control. Use secure storage mechanisms like environment variables or secret management tools.
- **Regenerate if Compromised**: If you suspect a token has been exposed, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.

### How to Manage API Tokens

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Workspace** from the settings navigation.
3.  Click on **API tokens**.
4.  Use the options to generate new tokens or manage existing ones.

_(The specific interface and options for API token management may vary in Complexus.)_
