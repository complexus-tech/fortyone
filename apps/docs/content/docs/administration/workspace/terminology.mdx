## Customize Workspace Terminology

Complexus allows you to adapt its vocabulary to match the language your team already uses. This helps with adoption and ensures the platform feels familiar.

### Configurable Terms

From the Terminology Preferences, you can customize the names for key entities within Complexus. The following terms are typically configurable:

| Default Term    | Customizable To (Examples) | Description                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stories**     | Issue, Task, Ticket, Item  | Small, actionable units of work in your system.                                                              |
| **Sprints**     | Iteration, Cycle, Period   | Time-boxed periods for completing a set of work items.                                                       |
| **Objectives**  | Goal, Target, OKR          | High-level goals that define what you want to achieve.                                                       |
| **Key Results** | Outcome, Metric, Indicator | Measurable outcomes that track progress towards Objectives. (Can be Focus Area, Milestone as per screenshot) |

_The screenshot shows dropdown menus for "Stories," "Sprints," and "Objectives," allowing selection from predefined alternatives or potentially custom input. For "Key results," the screenshot shows it can be changed to "Focus Area" or "Milestone."_

### Terminology Preview

A helpful "Terminology Preview" section often shows how your selected terms will appear in various parts of the application, such as:

- Navigation items (e.g., "My stories")
- Section titles (e.g., "Active sprints", "All objectives")
- Button labels (e.g., "Create Objective", "Start Sprint", "Create Story", "Add Key result")
- Informational text (e.g., "Track key results")

_The screenshot clearly displays a "Terminology Preview" section demonstrating these examples with the currently selected terms._

### How to Customize Terminology

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Workspace** from the settings navigation.
3.  Click on **Terminology**.
4.  For each configurable term (Stories, Sprints, Objectives, Key Results), use the dropdown menu to select your preferred alternative.
5.  Observe the **Terminology Preview** to see how your changes will look in the UI.
6.  Ensure you save your changes if a "Save" button is present (changes might also apply dynamically).

Customizing terminology can significantly improve clarity and adoption for your team by aligning Complexus with your established internal language.
