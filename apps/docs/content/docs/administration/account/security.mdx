## Account Security

These settings help you protect your Complexus account and manage how you authenticate.

### Login Methods

Complexus utilizes passwordless authentication for enhanced security and user convenience:

- **Magic Links**: Log in by clicking a unique, time-sensitive link sent to your registered email address.
- **Social Authentication**: Log in using your existing accounts from supported third-party providers (e.g., Google).

Because Complexus does not use traditional passwords, you won't find options here for changing a password.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (If Available)

- If Complexus supports 2FA, this section would allow you to enable and manage an additional layer of security for your account.
- Typically, this involves using an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator, Authy) or receiving codes via SMS (though app-based 2FA is generally more secure).
- You would find options to:
  - Set up 2FA by scanning a QR code or entering a setup key.
  - Generate recovery codes for use if you lose access to your 2FA device.
  - Disable 2FA if needed.

### Connected Accounts / Social Logins

- This area would show which third-party social accounts (e.g., Google) are linked to your Complexus profile for login purposes.
- You might find options to disconnect these accounts, though doing so could affect your ability to log in if it's your only authentication method.

### Active Sessions (If Available)

- Some platforms provide a list of active login sessions across different devices and browsers.
- This would allow you to review where your account is currently logged in and potentially revoke suspicious sessions.

### How to Manage Security Settings

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Account** from the settings navigation.
3.  Click on **Security**.
4.  Review and configure the available security options.
