## Notification Channels

FortyOne provides notifications to keep you updated on relevant activities within your workspace. You can choose your preferred channels for receiving these updates.

- **In-App Notifications**: Alerts and updates delivered directly within the FortyOne application.
- **Email Notifications**: Updates sent to the email address associated with your FortyOne account.

## Notification Types

You can customize which types of events trigger notifications to avoid clutter and stay focused on what matters most to you.

The following event types can be configured for both in-app and email notifications:

| Event Type             | Description                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Story updates**      | Get notified when a story you're involved with is updated.                                                         |
| **Comments**           | Get notified when someone comments on your stories.                                                                |
