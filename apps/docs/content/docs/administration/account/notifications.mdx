## Notification Channels

Complexus provides notifications to keep you updated on relevant activities within your workspace. You can typically choose your preferred channels for receiving these updates.

- **In-App Notifications**: Alerts and updates delivered directly within the Complexus application interface. These are often indicated by a badge or a dedicated notifications panel.
- **Email Notifications**: Updates sent to the email address associated with your Complexus account.

_As seen in the screenshot, you can select between "In-App" and "Email" notification channels._

## Notification Types

You can customize which types of events trigger notifications to avoid clutter and stay focused on what matters most to you.

### In-App Notification Preferences

The following event types can typically be configured for in-app notifications:

| Event Type             | Description                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Story updates**      | Get notified when a story you're involved with is updated.                                                         |
| **Comments**           | Get notified when someone comments on your stories.                                                                |
| **Mentions**           | Get notified when someone mentions you in a comment or story.                                                      |
| **Story comments**     | Get notified when comments are added to stories (likely a more general setting than "Comments" on _your_ stories). |
| **Objective updates**  | Get notified when objectives you are involved with are updated.                                                    |
| **Key result updates** | Get notified about updates to key results.                                                                         |

_As seen in the screenshot, each of these notification types has a toggle switch to enable or disable it for In-App notifications._

### Email Notification Preferences

(The screenshot focuses on In-App notifications. If email notification preferences are available, they would typically mirror or offer a subset of these options, allowing you to define which events also trigger an email.)

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Account** from the settings navigation.
3.  Click on **Notifications**.
4.  Choose your preferred channel (In-App or Email).
5.  Use the toggle switches to enable or disable notifications for specific event types.
