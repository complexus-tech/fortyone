## Your Profile

Your FortyOne profile helps your teammates identify you within the workspace and allows you to personalize some aspects of your user experience. These settings are specific to your individual account.

### Profile Information

Typically, you can manage the following personal details:

- **Full Name**: This is the name that will be displayed to other users in comments, assignments, mentions, and other areas throughout FortyOne. Ensure it's recognizable to your team members.
- **Avatar**: Your profile picture.
  - You can usually upload an image (e.g., JPG, PNG formats are common) to use as your avatar.
  - If no avatar is uploaded, FortyOne may display default initials based on your name.
- **Email Address (Read-Only)**: Your email address is used as your primary login identifier and for receiving notifications.
