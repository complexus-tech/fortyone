## Deleting Your User Account

This section explains how to permanently delete your individual Complexus user account. Please read this information carefully, as account deletion is an irreversible action.

**Important Considerations Before Deleting:**

- **Irreversible Action**: Once your account is deleted, it cannot be recovered. All personal settings, preferences, and links to your activity will be permanently removed.
- **Data Ownership & Contributions**:
  - Content you have created (e.g., stories, comments, objectives you own or are assigned to) might be handled in one of several ways, depending on Complexus's data retention policies for workspaces:
    - The content may be anonymized (attributed to a "Deleted User").
    - The content may be re-assigned to another user by a workspace administrator.
    - The content may be deleted if you are the sole owner and no other policies apply.
  - Deleting your user account **does not typically delete the workspace itself** if you are part of a larger team or organization. Workspace deletion is a separate administrative function (see Workspace Settings > Danger Zone).
- **Impact on Teams**: If you are part of any teams, your removal will be reflected in the team member lists.

### How to Delete Your Account

1.  Navigate to **Settings** (usually accessible via your user icon or a menu).
2.  Select **Account** from the settings navigation.
3.  Click on **Delete account**.
4.  **Confirmation**: You will likely be presented with a confirmation step. This may involve:
    - Reading a disclaimer about the consequences of account deletion.
    - Typing a specific word or phrase (e.g., "DELETE") to confirm your intent.
    - Re-authenticating (e.g., via magic link or social login) to verify your identity before proceeding.
5.  Once confirmed, your account will be scheduled for deletion or deleted immediately.

**If you are unsure about deleting your account, or if you need to preserve data, please consult with your workspace administrator or Complexus support before proceeding.**
