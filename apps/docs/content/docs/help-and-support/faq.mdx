  <Accordion title="What is Forty One?">
    Forty One is an adaptive project management platform designed for teams that
    prioritize speed, organization, and efficiency. It unifies work item
    tracking, sprint planning, objective management (OKRs), and real-time
    analytics to help you manage everything from strategic goals to daily tasks.
    For a more detailed overview, please see our [What is Forty
    One?](../start-here/what-is-forty-one) page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who is Forty One for?">
    Forty One is built for a wide range of teams, including startups, small to
    mid-sized companies, enterprise teams, product teams, engineering teams, and
    marketing & operations teams. If your team needs to plan, track, and deliver
    work collaboratively, Forty One can be tailored to your needs. More details
    can be found on our [What is Forty One?](../start-here/what-is-forty-one)

  <Accordion title="Is there a mobile app or mobile-friendly version of Forty One?">

## Account Management

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="How do I log in to Forty One?">
    Forty One uses passwordless authentication. You can log in using magic links
    sent to your email address or through available social authentication
    options (Google).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the email address associated with my account?">
    Currently, it is not possible to change the email address associated with
    your Forty One account. Your email address serves as the primary unique
    identifier for your account. If you need to use a different email address,
    you would need to create a new account.

## Features

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="What are 'Stories' and 'Objectives' in Forty One, and how are they different?">
    In Forty One, 'Stories' (also referred to as issues or tasks) are the
    individual units of work that your team acts upon. They represent specific
    deliverables, bugs, or improvements. 'Objectives', on the other hand,
    represent higher-level strategic goals or outcomes your team or organization
    is aiming to achieve. Stories can be linked to Objectives, showing how
    day-to-day work contributes to broader goals. Objectives are often tracked
    with Key Results (KRs) to measure progress.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize workflows for my stories/issues?">
    Forty One is designed for adaptability. While specific customization options
    can vary, the platform generally allows for tailoring workflows to suit your
    team's processes. For detailed information, please refer to our product
    guides or contact support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do team collaborations work in Forty One?">
    Teams are a core part of Forty One, allowing you to group members, assign
    work, and manage objectives collaboratively. Features like shared views,
    notifications, and comments facilitate seamless teamwork. Explore the
    "Teams" section within the app and our documentation for more details.
