## Core Concepts in Complexus

Complexus is built around several key concepts that work together to create a flexible, powerful project management experience. Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of the platform.

### Stories

Stories represent individual units of work in Complexus. More detailed than traditional tasks, stories capture not just what needs to be done, but why it matters. Each story includes:

- Description of the work to be completed
- Acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete
- Context that helps team members understand priorities
- Attachments, comments, and history for full transparency

Stories can be organized, prioritized, and tracked through your workflow, giving everyone visibility into what's happening and what's next.

### Objectives

Objectives are high-level goals that your team is working toward. They provide the strategic context for your day-to-day work, helping everyone understand how individual stories contribute to broader organizational aims.

Objectives in Complexus can be:

- Linked to specific time frames
- Connected to multiple stories
- Tracked with automated progress indicators
- Shared across teams for alignment

By structuring work around objectives, Complexus helps ensure that every completed story moves your team closer to what matters most.

### Sprints

Sprints are time-boxed work cycles that help teams focus and deliver value consistently. In Complexus, sprints provide:

- A clear view of work committed for the current cycle
- Real-time tracking of sprint progress and health
- Automatic calculation of team velocity
- Sprint planning tools with capacity management
- Retrospective support for continuous improvement

Whether you run one-week or multi-week sprints, Complexus makes it easy to plan, execute, and learn from each work cycle.

### Key Results

Key Results are measurable outcomes that indicate progress toward objectives. Unlike traditional KPIs, Key Results in Complexus are:

- Directly linked to objectives for context
- Automatically updated as related stories progress
- Visible to everyone for transparency
- Customizable to match your team's metrics

Key Results help teams stay focused on outcomes rather than output, ensuring that completed work delivers real value.

### Custom Terminology

Every organization has its own language for work. Complexus embraces this reality by allowing you to customize terminology throughout the platform. This means you can:

- Rename "stories" to "tasks," "issues," "tickets," or whatever term your team prefers
- Customize workflow states to match your process
- Define role names that reflect your organizational structure
- Create custom fields with terminology that makes sense for your team

This flexibility ensures Complexus speaks your language, reducing friction and making adoption seamless across your organization.

## How Concepts Work Together

In Complexus, these concepts create a cohesive system:

1. **Objectives** define what you want to achieve
2. **Key Results** measure progress toward those objectives
3. **Stories** break the work into manageable pieces
4. **Sprints** organize when and how the stories get done
5. **Custom Terminology** ensures everything makes sense to your team

This integrated approach provides both the high-level strategic view and the detailed tactical tools needed for effective project management.
