- **Landing Page**: http://localhost:3000
- **Documentation**: http://localhost:3002
- **Projects App**: http://localhost:3001/{workspace}/...
  - Example workspace: http://localhost:3001/my-workspace/my-work

## Code Structure

## Development Workflow

### Building Applications

```bash
# Build all apps and packages
pnpm build

# Build specific app
pnpm build --filter=landing
pnpm build --filter=docs
pnpm build --filter=projects
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Lint all packages
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests (projects app has Jest setup)
cd apps/projects
pnpm test
```

## Networking Architecture

Applications run on separate ports for development:

- `localhost:3000` (projects)
- `localhost:3001` (landing)
- `localhost:3002` (docs)

This setup allows for:

- **Clean application separation**: Each app runs independently
- **Simplified routing**: Path-based workspace navigation within the projects app
- **Easy development**: No complex proxy configuration needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts:**

- Check if ports 3000, 3001, 3002 are available
- Kill conflicting processes: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill`

**Dependencies issues:**

- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
- Clear Turbo cache: `pnpm turbo clean`
